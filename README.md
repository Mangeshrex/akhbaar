# Akhbaar

Akhbaar is an attempt at making a hugo theme which resembles an old newspaper! 

## Features 

- Clean and Minimal
- No Bloat
- Responsive 
- Tags Support
- Social Media Links Support 
- Custom CSS/JS 

## Installation

```sh 
cd themes 
git clone https://github.com/mangeshrex/akhbaar
```

## Configuration

To be updated soon. The theme is still in testing and lacks some features. 

## Credits 

Akhbaar is made on top of [ezhil](https://github.com/vividvilla/ezhil) and [hugo-ink](https://github.com/knadh/hugo-ink) (great themes in all). As you can see, these themes are no more maintained and do not comply with latest hugo versions. Perhaps, thats the frustration akhbaar would kill.
